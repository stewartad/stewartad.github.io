This doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide much functionality to users (yet) but enables more complex features in the future.\nIn addition, Discord has been changing their bot policies recently and will stop letting bots read full message contents starting early next year, requiring them instead to use \u0026ldquo;slash commands\u0026rdquo;. This policy is supposed to only affect bots in more than 100 guilds, which would leave SeekerBot unaffected, however the writing is on the wall. As a result of these policy changes, the developer of discord.py, the Python library which SeekerBot uses under the hood, has stopped further development. This means in the future, SeekerBot may need to be rewritten in a different language (or library) if Discord\u0026rsquo;s bot policy undergoes further changes. Luckily, the upgrades to the SeekerBot backend allow for an easier time migrating SeekerBot to follow the new rules.\nPer-Channel Reports #  Matches reported to SeekerBot now record which channel they were reported in. Matches reported before v2.0.0 will not have a channel associated with them. Leaderboards will still track matches across all channels in a guild.\nDeck Reporting #  You can now include deck names with your SeekerBot reports. There is also a leaderboard for decks, accessed with the new !decks command. This command will collect and display stats for decks that have been reported in the current channel only. For example:\nPrimus Match Reporting #  Primus matches can now be properly reported to SeekerBot. The syntax is the same as a normal report, except you can add an arbitrary number of users. For example:\nOther Changes #  These are some smaller changes to address some feedback\n Leaderboard time cutoffs now follow EST timezone Added help text with examples for each command  These are features coming in the full 2.0.0 release but are currently unavailable in beta1\n Stats command for decks Undo match report w/ increased time limit to 1 hour (This was available in 1.2 but needs to be implemented again in the new system) User stats command speed improvements Command options for accessing past leaderboards (For example, see the leaderboard for July 2021)  "}),a.add({id:2,href:'/posts/changelog_v1.1.0/',title:"SeekerBot 1.1.0",section:"Posts",content:"SeekerBot Version 1.1.0 Changelog #   Fixed !stats command for users without games logged in the current week and month implemented !undo command  undo can only be done within 5 minutes of the original report only one of the participants can undo the match (even if it was reported by someone else)   Fixed reporting mistakes "}),a.add({id:3,href:'/posts/welcome/',title:"Welcome",section:"Posts",content:"Hello #  This is my new site\n"})})()
